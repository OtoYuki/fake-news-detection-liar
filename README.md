# Fake News Detection Project

This project focuses on detecting fake news using the LIAR dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature extraction, and the implementation and evaluation of several machine learning models.

## Project Structure

- `fake_news_final.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow from data loading to model evaluation and visualization.
- `fake_news.ipynb`: An earlier version or alternative approach to the fake news detection task.
- `combine_dataset.ipynb`: A utility notebook to combine the different parts of the LIAR dataset (train, test, valid) into a single CSV file.
- `liar_dataset/`: This directory contains the LIAR dataset files.
  - `liars_dataset.csv`: The combined dataset created by `combine_dataset.ipynb`.
  - `README`: The original README for the LIAR dataset.
  - `test.tsv`, `train.tsv`, `valid.tsv`: The original dataset files.
- `*.joblib`: Saved machine learning models and the label encoder.
- `model_metrics.json`: Stores the performance metrics of the trained models.
- `visualization_data.json`: Data used for generating visualizations of model performance and analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust system for classifying news statements into six categories of truthfulness based on the LIAR dataset. This involves:

- Loading and preprocessing the text data.
- Performing EDA to understand data characteristics.
- Extracting features using TF-IDF.
- Training and evaluating machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Comparing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the **LIAR dataset**, which contains over 12,000 manually labeled short statements. The labels are:

- Pants-on-Fire
- False
- Barely-True
- Half-True
- Mostly-True
- True

For more details on the dataset, refer to `liar_dataset/README`.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OtoYuki/fake-news-detection-liar.git
    cd fake-news-detection-liar
    ```

2. **Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks:**
    - Start Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:

      ```bash
      jupyter lab
      # or
      jupyter notebook
      ```

    - Open and run the cells in `combine_dataset.ipynb` first to generate `liars_dataset.csv`.
    - Then, open and run the cells in `fake_news_final.ipynb` to see the main analysis and model training.

## Models and Evaluation

The following models were implemented and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, training time) for each model are stored in `model_metrics.json` and visualized in the `fake_news_final.ipynb` notebook. The Random Forest model generally performed the best.
